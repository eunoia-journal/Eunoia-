# Eunoia-
Eunoia is a thoughtfully designed personal wellbeing web application that goes beyond traditional journaling. It is a calm, distraction-free digital space created to help individuals pause, reflect, plan, and focus in a more intentional and emotionally mindful way.

Unlike productivity tools that prioritize speed and output, Eunoia centers on presence, self-awareness, and gentle structure. It integrates reflective practices with light planning and focus tools, supporting both the emotional and practical aspects of daily life.
